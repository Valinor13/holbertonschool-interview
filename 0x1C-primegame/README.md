# 0x1C Prime Game

In this project we will cover a common interview question, writing a prime numbers game.

## Task 0: Prime Game

Maria and Ben are playing a game. Given a set of consecutive integers starting from 1 up to and including n, they take turns choosing a prime number from the set and removing that number and its multiples from the set. The player that cannot make a move loses the game.
